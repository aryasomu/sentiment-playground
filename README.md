# Sentiment Analyzer Web App

This is a simple Flask-based web application that performs **sentiment analysis** on a user's input sentence and returns a basic interpretation of their current emotion (e.g., Happy, Sad, Neutral). It uses the `TextBlob` Python library for natural language processing and sentiment scoring.
